# APIs
Work with the weather.gov API to gather data on the weather of airports. 

User Story: 
 - I as a user would like to find out the current temperature at a airport.
 - I as a user would like to find out the temperature at an airport at certain times of day. 
 
Backlog: 
Incorporate the period portion of the temperature retrieval. 
 - Currently only gathers the current temperature.
 
More ways to search for airports other than the full name.
 - Incorporate ways to find best match when there are slight errors in the search term

Currently some airports do not have a point that works for weather.gov, find a way to retrieve this weather data possibly with a different API.
